# Data Driven Astronomy - Python & SQL Exercises

This repository contains exercises from the "Data Driven Astronomy" course offered by the University of Sydney

The schedule of the course and scope of each exercise is as follow:

1. Week 1 - introduction to pulsars, numpy module, FITS files, and using stacking algorithms (mean and median) to detect pulsars

   1b - Exercises to find mean set of signals of FITS files to detect pulsars

   1c - Exercises to find median set of signals of FITS files to detect pulsars as median is a more robust statistics. Finding median can be heavily memory consuming so a more efficient algorithm to find an approximate median for larger datasets has been used.
